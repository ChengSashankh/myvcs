# myvcs 

### What is it?

myvcs is an experimental (under development) Version Control System (VCS) built on Java, not for any performance considerations (like it could be possible), but merely for ease of development.

### Objectives:

The idea behind this project is to develop a simple VCS for personal use,
and to experiment with software design patterns.

### Implementation

myvcs is intended to run from a simulated shell. Projects in any directory may be managed from here , without having to store any vcs data in the project directory itself. This should allow for non-intrusive version control, so you can simulataneously manage the project with other VCS, should the need be.

### Is it ready? 

## NO,
not yet.
