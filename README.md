# myvcs 

### What is it?

myvcs is an experimental (under development) Version Control System (VCS) built on Java, not for any performance considerations (like it could be possible), but merely for ease of development.

### Objectives:

The idea behind this project is to develop a simple VCS for personal use,
and to experiment with software design patterns.

### Implementation

The idea is to run myvcs from a simulated shell to manage projects in any directory, without having to store any vcs data in the project directory itself, to allow for multiple version control systems to simulataneously manage the project, should the need be.

### Is it ready? 

## NO,
not yet.
